In DynamoDB, an index is a data structure that can be used to efficiently query data in a table. There are two types of indexes in DynamoDB: local secondary indexes and global secondary indexes.

A local secondary index allows you to query data based on the table's primary key, but with the added flexibility of using a different sort key than the one used for the table's primary key. This can be useful for querying data in different ways than the one used for the table's primary key.

A global secondary index, on the other hand, allows you to query data based on an entirely different primary key than the one used for the table. This can be useful for querying data that is not associated with the table's primary key, or for querying data in a different way than the one used for the table's primary key.

Overall, indexes in DynamoDB can be used to improve the performance of queries by allowing you to query data more efficiently. This can be especially useful for large tables with a lot of data, where efficient querying is critical to the performance of your application.

ElectroDB, queries are built around the **Access Patterns** defined in the Schema and are capable of using partial key **Composite Attributes** to create performant lookups. To accomplish this, ElectroDB defines partition and sort keys as a composite of one or more attributes. This is described at length in the [Modeling Indexes](/en/modeling/indexes) section.

## Query Methods

Retrieving data from DynamoDB is accomplished by using one of the four query methods: `query`, `scan`, `get`, and `batchGet`. The `query` method is used to retrieve data from a table or index by performing a key lookup. The `scan` method is used to retrieve data from a table by scanning the entire table. The `get` method is used to retrieve a single item from a table by performing a key lookup. The `batchGet` method is used to retrieve multiple items from a table by performing multiple key lookups.

Additionally, ElectroDB offers a few additional methods built on top of DynamoDB's offerings: `find` and `match`. These methods will perform a `query` or `scan` depending on the provided arguments. Below is a table that explains each ElectroDB method, which DynamoDB operation the method maps to, and a short description of the method's purpose.

ElectroDB Method                    | DynamoDB Method        | Purpose
----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------
[get](/en/queries/get)              | `get`                  | Returns a single item, specified by its primary key. 
[batchGet](/en/queries/batch-get)   | `batchGet`             | Returns a set of attributes for multiple items from one or more tables. 
[query](/en/queries/query)          | `query`                | Queries a table or index for items that match the specified primary key value. 
[scan](/en/queries/scan)            | `scan`                 | Scans the table and returns all matching items. 
[match](/en/queries/match)          | `query` or `scan`      | The `match` method will attempt to build the most performant index keys with the attributes provided. ElectroDB identifies which index it can be "most" fulfilled with the index provided, and will fallback to a `scan` if no index can be built.
[find](/en/queries/find)            | `query` or `scan`      | the `find` method performs the same index seeking behavior but will also apply all provided values as filters instead of only using provided attributes to build index keys.

## Mutation Methods

DynamoDB offers three methods for updating and creating records: `put`, `update`, and `batchWrite`. For the uninitiated, all three of these methods will create an item if it doesn't exist. The difference between `put`/`batchWrite` and `update` this that a `put` will overwrite the existing item while an `update` will only modify the fields provided if the item already exists.

Addtionally, ElectroDB offers a few mutation methods beyond `put`, `update`, and `delete` to more ergonomically fit your use case. Below is a table that explains each ElectroDB method, which DynamoDB operation the method maps to, and a short description of the method's purpose.

ElectroDB Method                    | DynamoDB Method        | Purpose
----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------
[put](/en/mutations/put)            | `put`, `batchWrite`    | Creates or overwrites an existing item with the values provided
[batchPut](/en/mutations/batch-put) | `batchWrite`       | Creates or overwrites multiple items with the values provided
[create](/en/mutations/create)      | `put`                  | Creates an item if the item does not currently exist, or throws if the item exists
[upsert](/en/mutations/upsert)      | `update`               | Upsert is similar to `put` in that it will create a record if one does not exist, except `upsert` perform an update if that record already exists.
[update](/en/mutations/update)      | `update`               | Performs update on an existing record or creates a new record per the DynamoDB spec ([read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateItem.html))
[patch](/en/mutations/patch)        | `update`               | Performs an update on existing item or throws if that item does not already exist.
[delete](/en/mutations/delete)      | `delete`, `batchWrite` | Deletes an item regardless of whether or not the specified item exists
[remove](/en/mutations/remove)      | `delete`               | Deletes an item or throws if the item does not currently exist

## Execution Methods

All query chains end with either a `.go()`, `.params()` method invocation. These terminal methods will either execute the query to DynamoDB (`.go()`) or return formatted parameters for use with the DynamoDB docClient (`.params()`).

Both `.params()` and `.go()` take a query configuration object which is detailed more in the section [Execution Options](/en/core-concepts/executing-queries).

### Params
The `params` method _ends_ a query chain, and synchronously formats your query into an object ready for the DynamoDB docClient.


> For more information on the options available in the `config` object, checkout the section [Execution Options](/en/core-concepts/executing-queries)

#### Example

```typescript
const params = MallStores.query
    .leases({ mallId })
    .between(
      { leaseEndDate:  "2020-06-01" }, 
      { leaseEndDate:  "2020-07-31" })
    .filter(attr) => attr.rent.lte("5000.00"))
    .params();
```

#### Output
```json
{
  "IndexName": "idx2",
  "TableName": "electro",
  "ExpressionAttributeNames": { "#rent": "rent", "#pk": "idx2pk", "#sk1": "idx2sk" },
  "ExpressionAttributeValues": {
    ":rent1": "5000.00",
    ":pk": "$mallstoredirectory_1#mallid_eastpointe",
    ":sk1": "$mallstore#leaseenddate_2020-06-01#rent_",
    ":sk2": "$mallstore#leaseenddate_2020-07-31#rent_"
  },
  "KeyConditionExpression": "#pk = :pk and #sk1 BETWEEN :sk1 AND :sk2",
  "FilterExpression": "#rent <= :rent1"
}
```

### Go
The `go` method _ends_ a query chain, and asynchronously queries DynamoDB with the `client` provided in the model.

> For more information on the options available in the `config` object, check out the section [Execution Options](/en/core-concepts/executing-queries)

#### Example
```typescript
const results = await MallStores.query
	.leases({ mallId })
	.between(
		{ leaseEndDate:  "2020-06-01" }, 
		{ leaseEndDate:  "2020-07-31" })
	.filter(({rent}) => rent.lte("5000.00"))
	.go();
```

#### Output
```typescript
{
  data: Array<YOUR_SCHEMA>,
  cursor: string | undefined
}
```

### Execution Options

Execution options can be added the `.params()` and `.go()` to change query behavior or add customer parameters to a query.

By default, **ElectroDB** enables you to work with records as the names and properties defined in the model. Additionally, it removes the need to deal directly with the docClient parameters which can be complex for a team without as much experience with DynamoDB. The Query Options object can be passed to both the `.params()` and `.go()` methods when building you query. Below are the options available:

```typescript
{
  params?: object;
  table?: string;
  data?: 'raw' | 'includeKeys' | 'attributes';
  pager?: 'raw' | 'cursor';
  originalErr?: boolean;
  concurrent?: number;
  unprocessed?: "raw" | "item";
  response?: "default" | "none" | "all_old" | "updated_old" | "all_new" | "updated_new";
  ignoreOwnership?: boolean;
  limit?: number;
  pages?: number | 'all';
  logger?: (event) => void;
  listeners Array<(event) => void>;
  preserveBatchOrder?: boolean;
  attributes?: string[];
  order?: 'asc' | 'desc';
};
```

Option             | Default              | Description
------------------ | :------------------: | -----------
params             | `{}`                 | Properties added to this object will be merged onto the params sent to the document client. Any conflicts with **ElectroDB** will favor the params specified here.
table              | _(from constructor)_ | Use a different table than the one defined in the [Service Options](/en/modeling/services#options)
attributes         | _(all attributes)_   | The `attributes` query option allows you to specify ProjectionExpression Attributes for your `get` or `query` operation. As of `1.11.0` only root attributes are allowed to be specified.
data               | `"attributes"`       | Accepts the values `'raw'`, `'includeKeys'`, `'attributes'` or `undefined`. Use `'raw'` to return query results as they were returned by the docClient. Use `'includeKeys'` to include item partition and sort key values in your return object. By default, **ElectroDB** does not return partition, sort, or global keys in its response.
pager              | `cursor`             | Used in with pagination calls to override ElectroDBs default behaviour to return a serialized string cursor. See more detail about this in the sections for [Pager Query Options](/en/queries/pagination#pager).
originalErr        | `false`              | By default, **ElectroDB** alters the stacktrace of any exceptions thrown by the DynamoDB client to give better visibility to the developer. Set this value equal to `true` to turn off this functionality and return the error unchanged.
concurrent         | `1`                  | When performing batch operations, how many requests (1 batch operation == 1 request) to DynamoDB should ElectroDB make at one time. Be mindful of your DynamoDB throughput configurations.
unprocessed        | `"item"`             | Used in batch processing to override ElectroDBs default behaviour to break apart DynamoDBs `Unprocessed` records into composite attributes. See more detail about this in the sections for [BatchGet](/en/queries/batch-get), [BatchDelete](/en/mutations/batch-delete), and [BatchPut](/en/mutations/batch-put).
response           | `"default"`          | Used as a convenience for applying the DynamoDB parameter `ReturnValues`. The options here are the same as the parameter values for the DocumentClient except lowercase. The `"none"` option will cause the method to return null and will bypass ElectroDB's response formatting -- useful if formatting performance is a concern.
ignoreOwnership    | `false`              | By default, **ElectroDB** interrogates items returned from a query for the presence of matching entity "identifiers". This helps to ensure other entities, or other versions of an entity, are filtered from your results. If you are using ElectroDB with an existing table/dataset you can turn off this feature by setting this property to `true`.
limit              | _none_               | A target for the number of items to return from DynamoDB. If this option is passed, Queries on entities and through collections will paginate DynamoDB until this limit is reached or all items for that query have been returned.
pages              | 1                    | How many DynamoDB pages should a query iterate through before stopping. To have ElectroDB automatically paginate through all results, pass the string value `'all'`.
order              | 'asc'                | Convenience option for `ScanIndexForward`, to the change the order of queries based on your index's Sort Key -- valid options include 'asc' and 'desc'. [[read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html)]
listeners          | `[]`                 | An array of callbacks that are invoked when [internal ElectroDB events](/en/reference/events-logging) occur.
logger             | _none_               | A convenience option for a single event listener that semantically can be used for logging.
preserveBatchOrder | `false`              | When used with a [batchGet](/en/queries/batch-get) operation, ElectroDB will ensure the order returned by a batchGet will be the same as the order provided. When enabled, if a record is returned from DynamoDB as "unprocessed" ([read more here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_BatchGetItem.html)), ElectroDB will return a null value at that index.
