In ElectroDB an `Entity` represents a single business object. For example, in a simple task tracking application, one Entity could represent an Employee and or a Task that is assigned to an employee.

ElectroDB was created with Single-Table Design in mind. As a result, entities created by ElectroDB will automatically be isolated from entities created by ElectroDB. In turn, this means a single dynamodb table is capable of containing an infinite number of ElectroDB entities.

## Creation

Entities are defined via a [Schema](/en/modeling/schema), passed to the Entity's constructor.

```typescript
import DynamoDB from "aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb";
import { Entity } from 'electrodb';

const client = new DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

const table = 'electro';

const Task = new Entity({
	model: {
		entity: "task",
		version: "1",
		service: "taskapp",
	},
	attributes: {
		task: {
			type: "string",
			default: () => uuid(),
		},
		project: {
			type: "string",
		},
		employee: {
			type: "string",
		},
		description: {
			type: "string",
		},
	},
	indexes: {
		task: {
			pk: {
				field: "pk",
				composite: ["task"],
			},
			sk: {
				field: "sk",
				composite: ["project", "employee"],
			},
		},
		project: {
			index: "gsi1pk-gsi1sk-index",
			pk: {
				field: "gsi1pk",
				composite: ["project"],
			},
			sk: {
				field: "gsi1sk",
				composite: ["employee", "task"],
			},
		},
		assigned: {
			collection: "assignments",
			index: "gsi3pk-gsi3sk-index",
			pk: {
				field: "gsi3pk",
				composite: ["employee"],
			},
			sk: {
				field: "gsi3sk",
				composite: ["project", "task"],
			},
		},
	},
}, {table, client});
```

Additionally, as a second parameter to the constructor, ElectroDB accepts an "options" object that defines the electrodb `TableName` and a DynamoDB DocumentClient.

## Entity Definition (Schema)
Property       | Description
-------------- | ----------- 
model.service  | Name of the application using the entity, used to namespace all entities
model.entity   | Name of the entity that the schema represents
model.version  | The version number of the schema, used to namespace keys
attributes     | An object containing each attribute that makes up the schema
indexes        | An object containing table indexes, including the values for the table's default Partition Key and Sort Key

## Entity Options
Property | Description
-------- | ----------- 
table    | The name of the dynamodb table in aws.
client   | (optional) An instance of the `docClient` from the `aws-sdk` for use when querying a DynamoDB table. This is optional if you wish to only use the `params` functionality, but required if you actually need to query against a database.
